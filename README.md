## Class to set a form min/max size \!


</div>

### Description



This is a wrapper class that allows you to set minimum and maximum sizes of a form. Never do again checks on the Form_Resize() event, that flickers! This one uses APIs calls to set maximum and mimimum sizes. Four functions calls are needed in the form.

I had a look into PSC, and I found nothing similar to this.

Have a look at it, and leave comments!

Parts of these code are from www.vbaccelerator.com, but this is easier and much better.... :-)
